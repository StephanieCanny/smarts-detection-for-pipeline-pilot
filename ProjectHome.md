SMARTS Detection for Pipeline Pilot detects substructures from the following groups:

  1. PAINS groups A,B and C (1)
  1. Warheads (2)
  1. Frequents Hitters (3)
  1. Promiscuous Inhibitors (4)
  1. Chemical Groups (5)

The SMARTS for PAINS substructures were obtained from Rajarshi Guha's blog: http://blog.rguha.net/?p=850. The SMARTS for the remainder of the substructures were obtained from the FAF-Drugs2 tool (5).
